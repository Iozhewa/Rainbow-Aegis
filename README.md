# Rainbow-Aegis
CBRC 2024 Showcase Project. Exploring hashes as a form of cryptographic password storage and modification detection.
## Currently I'm trying to achieve the following:
- Create an educational capture-the-flag with 16 points in the bank...
  - Packet Tracer: Investigate DHCP, Access-List (secret: unused gigabitEthernet)
  - Git Repository: Investigate prebootRoster vs postbootRoster
    - Python: CALM.py, SystemSyster.py, Quizard.py
  - Trivia Qs: Router (2), Server (2), Bus Topology (2), Ring Topology (2)
  - Secret (Meme) Flags: 2
- More goals realized soon...
