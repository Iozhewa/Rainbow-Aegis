# Encryption Algorithms: Hashing
Hashing is the process of assigning data to fixed values. These outputs are known as message digests, or `checksums`.

Explore some of the ways hash functions protect sensitive data with this CTF.
## Learning Intentions
- Exploring the integration of cryptography into Local Area Networks
